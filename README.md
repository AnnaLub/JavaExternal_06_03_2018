task_1: Use loops and next methods: System.out.print ("*"), System.out.print (""),System.out.print ("\ n") for displaying on the screen next figures: rectangle, right-angled triangle, equilateral triangle, diamond.
task_2: Sequence sorting: 1. arrange the one-dimensional array firstly negative in ascending order then positive in descending order; 2. In a one-dimensional array, arrange firstly positive then negative for O(n).
task_3: Given an integer rectangular matrix: 1. Arrange the columns in descending order by average value; 2. Arrange rows in ascending order by the longest series of the same elements.
task_4: Create a dynamic array of different shapes and display the information on the screen.
task_5: Create a Polygon class to describe shapes of different dimensions.
task_6: 1. In created class Polygon serialize the next figures: 3 points 3 lines and 1 triangle; 2. When the triangle is deserialized, display how many objects was created (points and lines); 3. make 3 files with serial Polygon which will describe 3 different shapes (rectangle, square rectangle and triangle) and deserialize by displaying on the screen (to build a house from deserialized shapes).
